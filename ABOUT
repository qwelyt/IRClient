IRClient is a simple Java IRC client.

I can connect to both unencrypted ports as well
as encrypted (using SSL) ports on any server.

To properly be able to use IRClient, you should
read >>IRClient.help<< as this explains how the 
client can be used.
After reading IRClient.help, you should probably
set your settings in IRClient.conf.


The client currently only supports a graphical
interface. Plans were to also incluade a 
terminal interface. This seemed possible at the
start, but unfortunately the package that was to 
be used (charva, 
http://www.pitman.co.za/projects/charva/index.html )
did not compile and could therefore not be used.
The existing code is however fully functional for
a possible TUI (or a different type of GUI).

The client itself can do the basics. You can talk
in channels, talk in querys (IRC-querys, not CTCP),
and perform the /me action.
If standing on the Server-buffer, you can send text
directly to the server, without any code meddeling
in the formatting of it. This is not a bug. It was
intended and is there just because IRClient does
not have full support for _everything_. If you
really need to send something that is not supported,
by all means, send it via the server-buffer.

CTCP has *not* been implemented, more than the
/me ACTION command, as this is quite popular on IRC.


Now, Enjoy IRClient!
